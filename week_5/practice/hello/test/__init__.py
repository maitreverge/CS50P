# File `__init__.py` Is a special file
# that indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.
# It can be empty, or it can contain code that should be executed when the package is imported.
# It is not necessary to include an `__init__.py` file in a package directory in Python 3.3 and later,
# but it is still a good practice to include it for compatibility with older versions of Python.
# The `__init__.py` file can also be used to define the public API of the package,
# by specifying which modules or functions should be accessible when the package is imported.
# In this case, the `__init__.py` file is empty,
# but it could also contain code to initialize the package or to define package-level variables or functions.
